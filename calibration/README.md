# Calibration Artifacts

- `channel_separator.json`: runtime calibration output. Ignored in git; generated by the calibration tool.
- `channel_separator.template.json`: template with identity values. Duplicate this file before first run if no calibration has been performed yet.

Keep measurement logs under `logs/` rather than this directory to avoid mixing raw inputs with derived parameters.
